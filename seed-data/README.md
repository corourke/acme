### Notes

`item_categories_001.csv` and `item_categories_002.csv` each have half the data of `item_categories.csv` if you want to try uploading one data file at a time for ingest from S3.

`retail_stores_full.csv` has about 3x the stores, this will increase the number of transactions generated as transactions will be generated for each store.
